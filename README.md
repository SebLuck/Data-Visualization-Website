# Data-Visualization-Website
Data Visualization website using AWS, TypeScript, JavaScript and Web Services.  

This project consists of a website on data visualization of cryptocurrencies. When the clients connect to the website, they will be able to see the historical data with its prediction for each cryptocurrency, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, and Litecoin. Moreover, the sentiment analysis is illustrated in a pie chart for each cryptocurrency, showing the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral news about each currency. The historical data were obtained using the CryptoCompare API, and the text data with the NewsAPI. The technologies used include S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, and Sagemaker, which are from Amazon Web Services (AWS).
